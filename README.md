# CROP-DISCRIMINATION-USING-MACHINE-LEARNING-AND-GEE-A-STUDY-OF-UDHAM-SINGH-NAGAR-
This project explores crop discrimination using machine learning techniques and remote sensing data within Google Earth Engine (GEE), focusing on the agriculturally rich Udham Singh Nagar district of Uttarakhand, India. By integrating multi-temporal Sentinel-2 (optical) and Sentinel-1 (microwave) satellite imagery, the study aimed to classify major land cover types—mainly rice and sugarcane fields—across the monsoon season of 2023. Five ML classifiers (RF, SVM, KNN, CART, and GBM) were evaluated, with ensemble methods yielding the highest accuracy (up to 90.25%). The fusion of optical and microwave data significantly improved classification performance, especially during cloudy months, showcasing the strength of multi-sensor analysis. Key vegetation indices like NDVI, EVI, and NDBI were also used to enhance the accuracy of seasonal crop mapping. This project demonstrates the potential of machine learning and GEE for operational, scalable, and high-accuracy land use and crop monitoring in complex agricultural landscapes.
